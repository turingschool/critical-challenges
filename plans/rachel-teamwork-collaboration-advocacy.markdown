# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to use the projects in Module 2 to build up students’ skills in teamwork, collaboration, and self-advocacy.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

Module 2 is the first module where students are working collaboratively with more than one other person. Typically, it's also the module when students realize that collaborating with 2 or more other people can be challenging due to personalities, work styles, etc.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

By equiping students with the skills to work collaboratively and self-advocate, they will be better prepared for module 3 and 4 teams and the workplace. 

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

- potential personality conflicts in module 3 and 4 during group projects. 
- difficulty with jobs where teamwork is required

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I've anchored module 2? 

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

Hardly anything. We have one class on git workflow, but no classes around conflict management, etc. 

* Was it effective? How do you know?

The git workflow class seems to be effective in terms of teaching students how to write user stories and track issues with Waffle, but we don't cover anything relating to interpersonal conflicts. 

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Gear Up is somewhat related. 

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

-start researching strategies for teaching communication, listening, teamwork, and self-advocacy to adults
-look for times in the module 2 schedule where these "soft skills" can be addressed on a regular basis

* What will be the next three things you do?

-prepare class material for teamwork, collaboration, and self-advocacy
-teach classes
-gather data relating to whether or not the classes are working

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

-weekly surveys
-anecdotal evidence of fewer team conflicts and more collaboration
-discussions in group retros
-peer feedback for each group project

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

-sure

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

-Students are comfortable beginning a project with a group
-Students are able to adjust their workflows to accomodate group preferences
-Students are able to address interpersonal issues effectively without relying on staff intervention
-Students feel excited about and successful in group projects

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

-peer feedback and evaluations
-Friday surveys

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

* How feasible are each of those goals?

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

? 

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

-strategies for teaching communication, listening, teamwork, and self-advocacy to adults

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

?

* Which other challenges does this align with?

-We need to find the applicants who possess the academic potential and characteristics necessary for community building and success in the program.

-We need to prepare students for the job hunt with effective strategies, clear and realistic expectations, and an ability to represent the skills they’ve developed.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

-Turing's mentor network
-Daisha, Marissa

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?
