# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

The challenge is how to improve the onramp for students both before they start Module 1 and the first few days of the module.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

This is a challenge because students come in with varying degrees of skill and aptitude, and to get them to all reach a baseline of 
knowledge is difficult, epsecially with a sort of a "rolling" admissions policy when people commit to a start date at different times.
On top of that, a number of them are moving to Denver, so the time that should be dedicated to pre-work is combined with a very high
level of stress. However, there is not enough data to conclude if there is a correlation between moving to Denver for Turing and
module 1 success.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

I don't know if it is something that can be "solved," but it is certainly something that can be improved on.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

If we fail to solve it, we will continue to have issues with frustrated students, and confidence levels, potentially resulting in an 
unacceptable number of students repeating module 1.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

The Module 1 experience is freshest in my mind and I spend a lot of time with the current first cohort, so I have a good insight into
what they are going through, and an insight into their challenges and their successes.


## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

So far, pre-work has been very hands off. It's been here's Pragmatic Studio, let us know if you have any questions. We are starting
to get more organized with Q and A sessions.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

I would say that it has been at least somewhat effective. Turing has graduated four cohorts so far, with only, as far as I know, 
three individuals unable to proceed past module 1.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

I do not know.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now? 

I would like whoever is teaching Module 1 to be more active in the preparation of the incoming cohort. I'd like to schedule short 
meetings each to gauge where they are and how they feel.

* What will be the next three things you do?

I would give 1507 access to Slack right now. I would write a series of diagnostics for 1507 so that we have a better idea of where
the group stands coming into module one and not say after their first project. I would assign them to posses right now so they meet
their posse-mates and their mentors.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

The aforementioned diagnostics from the previous question. We would log those as we currently do. We could also measure their 
performance after the first project. 

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

This is a tricky question, because I don't feel that I should just be making decisions all willy-nilly. That being said, I do feel 
very comfortable asking the team for their opinions and input and know that any suggestions that I do make would be considered 
thoughtfully, and I would receive good, specific feedback on my suggestions at the minimum.

 
## The Future

* What would total success look like?

The bottom range of project evaluation scores would rise, and the top end as well. 

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

Project and assessment scores. The sentiment of end of week surveys and group retros.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

Meaningful progress would show no repeats during module one and fewer people doing The Chisel. Success over longer periods of times 
would show a general upwards trend.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

Improvement is feasible. Perfection less so. It can be difficult to sustain improvement, as we can only really iterate once every six 
weeks. If something doesn't work, we have to wait six weeks to try something different. 


## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

This shouldn't take up too much of my time, and to start, most of the investment time-wise is up-front. Diagnostics need only 
be written from scratch once, and are something that can be collaborated on.


* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I think I'd have to take a look and see what new tools there are for learning Ruby or OO or other topics. Pragmatic Studio is 
fantastic, but I think we should be open to the possibility that there is better.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

Right now feedback and the go ahead to implement plans.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

I think having a high quality flow of incoming applicants makes this challenge easier.


* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

The staff as well as the mentors.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?
