# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need students to be well-prepared for the technical challenges and code reviews in their job hunting process.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

We have seen numerous examples of otherwise successful or talented
students "freezing up" or otherwise underperforming in focused technical
interview peparation. This has been especially frustrating in many cases since it
doesn't demonstrate an accurate representation of the students'
abilities.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Improving student technical interview performance would likely give us
might higher job yields overall. It often takes a lot of effort to "open
the door" on a job opportunity (getting past initial gatekeepers, etc),
so it's particularly damaging when students get through these early
hurdles only to be stopped by a technical interview.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Students will continue to struggle with the job search. Some might be
unable to find jobs, and many will end up with less exciting job
opportunities than they could have had.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

- interviewed lots of eng candidates at livingsocial
- have been running DSA sessions since being at Turing, focusing on
  more CS-heavy topics that often appear in interviews

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

- DSA as ongoing elective
- Monday Technical Interview Prep sessions over recent months
- Moving module 3 and 4 assessments to more intensive solo technical
  projects
- Adding regular long code challenges in module 4 to get students more
  accustomed to the time-crunch environment

* Was it effective? How do you know?

Effective in some cases. Have heard instances of students
being interviewed on topics covered in DSA or TIP. But not yet the
universal reach we would like to see.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Has been a general group challenge, and especially Jeff's with the TIP
work. Jeff identified the original problem based on student feedback
from job interviews.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

- Turn DSA into more of a test/problem-solving session? (less free-form,
  more structured)?
- Start having regular 1-on-1 practice interviews with module 3 and 4
  students (how to schedule this? where to get the time?)

* What will be the next three things you do?

1. Add some of the individual code challenges we've been doing
   with module 4 into module 3. (try to get students ramped up earlier)
2. Generate set of standardized code challenges that mirror technical
   interviews.
3. Come up with an ongoing "track" of interview practice sessions that
   module 3 and 4 sessions would be expected to perform. Use performance
   in these sessions to track progress.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

- Need to start collecting more regular post-intervierw feedback from students. (Q: How to enforce this?)
- In-house mock interviews graded similarly to end-of-module assessments

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

- Most options as outlined require extra-curricular / out of hours time
  (DSA, adding more interview sessions, etc). For more aggressive
  progress we may need to carve out more time from schedules in modules
  3 and 4.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

- Students would feel confident going into technical interviews
- No more stories of "they asked me to do X but I froze up"
- Turing students becoming well-known through the community for being
  confident and capable under pressure

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

- Need to collect better/more organized feedback about student interview
  experiences
- Need to build better repository of actual interview questions to measure
  student performance in practice sessions
- Measure # of students getting to technical interviews vs # of students
  getting jobs (funnel stats)

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

- Short Term -- "Top Performing" students no longer struggling/freezing in
  technical interviews
- Medium / Long Term -- Students across the board are able to solve
  relatively complex technical/algorithmic challenges under pressure

* How feasible are each of those goals?

With appropriate changes in the curriculum, this is pretty feasible, but
it will require adding another significant "area of focus" to an already
packed curriculum.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

Q: I don't know. Less teaching? Less interviews?

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

- Need to accumulate more interview problems and practice using them
- Need to research tools for tracking student interview feedback

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

- Need to be able to add additional work, sessions into mod 3/4
  schedules

* Which other challenges does this align with?

- Software: track student job interviews
- Software: augment job hunting process with new tools
- Lifecycle:  prepare students for the job hunt with effective strategies, clear and realistic expectations, and an ability to represent the skills they’ve developed.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

- Other instructors; possible future solicit mentors to provide mock
  interviews as well
- Marissa, Daisha, Jeff -- Helping to encourage students to provide
  feedback regularly and make tracking/reporting part of the process

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

- Q: Not sure
