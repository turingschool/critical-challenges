# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to develop a coherent, effective package of recommended tools and settings for students in the program.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

Getting all of the students' comptuers at a baseline so they can start learning in earnest is difficult because
when students bring their computers, it is an unknown state.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

It can be solved, there are a number of tools that can help us in this regard.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

We expend a large amount of person-hours getting students set up.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I have an ops background and know of some of the tools that can help fix this.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

We have a tutorial on how to set up your environment.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

It works, people can make apps.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Jeff and Josh spearheaded this. We've just thrown time at it.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

Start investigating tools like Vagrant.

* What will be the next three things you do?

Take a second look at the tutorial and look to improve it. Start building a vagrant server to test feasibility. See what the learning 
curve is with a Linux VM.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

Measure how many person-hours are used in setup and post setup troubleshooting.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

If we use less time to set up students computers.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

How many class hours and outside of class hours are devoted to setup.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

More instrcutional hours that can be devoted to curriculum instead of setup.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

On paper, pretty feasible.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

This is probably the lowest priority challenge - it has become less of an issue since Macs have started to ship with ruby 2.0.0
installed.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

Learn Varagnt!

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

Maybe some hardware if this becomes successful.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

The onramping.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?
Jeff.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

Horace or Steve
