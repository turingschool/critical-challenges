# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to push our learnings, strategy, and resources to empower K12 and adult learners outside the Turing community.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

It's difficult to balance meeting the needs of Turing students with providing content and resources for people outside of the Turing community. 

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

By pushing our resources beyond Turing's doors, we not only spread Turing's brand, but we also are able to get feedback on content in order to continually improve. We also are providing education to learners outside of Turing that they may not otherwise receive. 

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Unsure. 

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

Have worked with kids in the past; enjoy working with beginners. 

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

One-time outreach events to a middle school and Hope House. Recurring events to a high school and a KIPP middle school. 

* Was it effective? How do you know?

I think that the individual events were effective in the moment. Whether or not those events spurred continued action is debatable. 

It was difficult with the recurring events to keep up student volunteer enthusiasm. The first few events had several volunteers, but participation in the subsequent ones dwindled because of projects, assessments, etc. and it's hard for new volunteers to jump on board when they have no idea what came before. 

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Raissa/Daisha/myself have all discussed it at some point. It's tricky to manage creating quality content for our students and also create content for outreach events. 

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?
* What will be the next three things you do?
* How will you keep track of progress and results?
* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

## The Future

* What would total success look like?
* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?
* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?
* How feasible are each of those goals?

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?
* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?
* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?
* Which other challenges does this align with?
* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?
* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?
