# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to augment the job hunting process with effective existing tools (both internal and external) and train staff and students to use them.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

Students continue to struggle with surfacing job and networking
opportunities. But we know there are tons of these out there that we
haven't even identified.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Possibly. Value would be more efficiency and coverage in the job-hunt
process. Possibly removing some of the angst/paralysis students seem to
encounter in early job-hunt phases that results in lots of inefficient
time usage.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Students continue pulling from a smaller pool of potential
opportunities, and we end up having lots of duplicated conversations and
lost opportunities due to lack of information centralization.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I've been working on people.turing.io and the turingapps site which are
targeted at presenting info to employers.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

- Job Hunt repo / channel
- people.turing.io
- Jeff's manual tracking of student job requirements (resumes,
  portfolio submissions)

* Was it effective? How do you know?

Definitely better than nothing. Jeff seems to value the portfolio sites
as a very easy way to share students with employers. Helps us to "strike
while the iron is hot"

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Jeff mostly.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

Need to have some discussions with other Turing staff to try to
understand what tools are most needed.

* What will be the next three things you do?

1. Investigate previous turing community projects around job stuff (are
   any of these useful)
2. Research existing off-the-shelf tools for this type of role to see if
   any of them would be a good fit for us.
3. ???

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

Launch a tool and track its adoption. Do we get students to start using
it and is it helping them.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

We would actually know what's going on with job hunt process. Students
stepping into job hunt process would feel like they were moving into a
well-controlled and monitored funnel (rather than an amorphous and very
unstructured space).

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?
* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?
* How feasible are each of those goals?

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

Q: Unsure

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

Need to learn about the space and what tools might be useful

Need to learn about what our needs actually are

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

Probably lots of discussion with Marissa to figure out what I need to
even do.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

- Academic: Interview preparedness
- Software: augment job hunting process with new tools

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Marissa, Jeff

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

Unknown
