# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

Coming up with a way to provide effective support outside of "business hours" without overburdening instructional staff.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

It is difficult to maintain productivity without having instructional staff work an absurd amount of horus.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

There are approaches to attempt in order to continue to make the evening be productive.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Students will feel that outside of the day they are on their own.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

Having the Turing experience fresh in my mind.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

The most effective so far has been scheduling pairing sessions in the evening post classes.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

1505 has started to arrange more mentor pairing sessions in the evening outside of assigned ones.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

I believe that Jeff was looking into ways to further this.


## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

Continue mentor pairing in the evening.

* What will be the next three things you do?

Continue to schedule pairing sessions with 1505. Reach out to our wonderful mentors to get free times and just force all students
to pair. Perhaps have an "On-Duty Mentor"

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

Measure at the number of people who continue to work at Turing into the evening.
 
* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Definitely.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

A larger number of people staying at Turing to work during the evening.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

Perhaps we can track how many mentor hours were used on a weekly basis.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

A higher percentage of students in the building on weekends and evenings would certainly indicate meaningful progress.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

I think that it's quite feasible, considering our mentors are incredibly generous with their time.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

Probably look at tools less.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

Finding a way to measure people in building.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

The support of our mentors.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

Most likely student onboarding.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Mentors.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

Rachel and Steve.
