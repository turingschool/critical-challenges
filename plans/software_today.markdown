## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need the Today app to make it easy for students and staff to know where they should be and when.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

Schedules are hard, and things are very fluid.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

It can be improved, I don't think it can be solved. Calendaring is hard, and proof of that is the lack of really good
commercial calendaring software.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

We have the status quo, with occasional bits of confusion.
 
* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I've been doing the calendar this module.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

There are a number of shared calendars, and I've been trying to build out the entirety of the next week, so people have at least 
a rough idea of plans for the upcoming week.
 
* Was it effective? How do you know?

It works well enough. People figure out where they are supposed to be.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

I would like to have a deadline of say Thursday or so for the schedule for the upcoming week to have a good amount of time to prep
Today for the upcoming week. This is, as always, a soft deadline as to give staff the ability to call 
[audibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback#Special_tactics). 

* What will be the next three things you do?

Look for ways to improve the Today app. Ask for schedules earlier. Continue to do schedules a week in advance.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

A focus group would probably be pretty helpful.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Pull requests for days. Yes.


## The Future

* What would total success look like?

No more double bookings, less confusion.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

We could add things to a survey.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

Perhaps more today automation, a way to hook into Google Calendar that will autobuild Today.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

Improving the process is certainly probable. Automating it, maybe.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

This one is a lower priority than other challenges.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

A close look at the Google Calendars API.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

Having schedules planned out in advance more.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

I think this tangentially touches most of the academic challenges.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

The Joshes.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?
